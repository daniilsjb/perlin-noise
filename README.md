# Perlin Noise

![Preview Image](preview.png)

## Features

Quick and simple implementation of Perlin Noise algorithm in 1D, 2D, and 3D in C++ with no external dependencies. This code may easily be reused by simply including the header and source files into any project. All relevant code is written as a small set of pure functions that work with both floats and doubles.

## Demo

The repository contains a small demonstration written with [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) that displays the 3D noise as an animated grayscale with respect to time.
